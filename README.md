## Java and Scala
This is my little playground project where I solve coding exercises,
experiment with Java and Scala interoperability, as well as build, test and generate reports.

## Setting up the project in IntelliJ IDEA
1. install the Scala plugin
2. clone and open the project
3. In the settings, enable "sbt shell" for **project load** and **builds**
