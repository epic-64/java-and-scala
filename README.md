## Java and Scala
This is my little playground project where I
- learn Scala (and a bit of Java) and the way of the JVM
- solve coding exercises (often using AI for the initial draft, because I'm a dummy)
- experiment with Java and Scala interoperability
- build and test code
- aggressively try out different code styles and patterns (inconsistent code style is to be expected)

## Setting up the project in IntelliJ IDEA
1. install the Scala plugin
2. clone and open the project
3. In the settings, enable "sbt shell" for **project load** and **builds**
